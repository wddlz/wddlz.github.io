							<p>
								Data wrangling is a difficult and time-consuming activity. Consequently, data scientists spend a 
								substantial portion of their time preparing data rather than performing data analysis tasks such as modeling 
								and prediction.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through formative interviews with seven professional data scientists, we identified 
								an unaddressed gap between existing data wrangling tools and how data scientists prefer to work within their notebooks. 
								<br/>
								<br/>

								First, data scientists did not want to leave their native notebook environment to perform wrangling. 
								This lead to design goal 1: 
								<br/>
								&emsp;&emsp;<strong>DG1: </strong><i>Data wrangling tools should be available where the data scientist worksâ€”within their notebooks.</i>
								<br/>
								<br/>

								Second, data scientists were reluctant to use data wrangling tools that transformed their data through "black boxes", 
								and instead wanted to inspect the code that transformed their data.								
								This lead to design goal 2: 
								<br/>
								&emsp;&emsp;<strong>DG2: </strong><i>Data wrangling tools should produce code as an inspectable and modifable artifact, using programming languages already familiar to the data scientist.</i>
								<br/>
								<br/>

								To address this gap, we introduce a hybrid interaction model that reconciles the productivity benefits of interactivity with the versatility 
								of programmability called Wrex.
							</p>
							<p>
								Wrex is a programming-by-example environment within a computational notebook, 
								which supports a variety of program transformations to accelerate common data wrangling activities (Figure above). 
								<br/>
								(A) Users create a dataframe with their dataset and sample it. 
								<br/>
								(B) Wrex's interactive grid where users can derive a new column and give data transformation examples. 
								<br/>
								(C) Wrex's code window containing synthesized code generated from grid interactions. 
								<br/>
								(D) Synthesized code inserted into a new input cell.
								<br/>
								(E) Applying synthesized code to full dataframe and plotting results.
								<br/>								<br/>

								<strong>Contributions of this project:</strong>
								<br/>								
								(1) We propose this hybrid interaction model that combines programming-by-example with readable code synthesis 
								within the cell-based workflow of computational notebooks. We implement this interaction model as a Jupyter 
								notebook extension for Python, using an interactive grid and provisional code cell.
								<br/>								<br/>
								
								(2) We apply program synthesis to the domain of data science in a scalable way. Up until now, program synthesis has been restricted to Excel-like settings where the user wants to transform a small amount of data. Our approach allows data scientists to synthesize code on subsets of their data and to apply this code to other, larger datasets. The synthesized code can be incorporated into existing data pipelines.
								<br/>								<br/>

								(3) Through a user study, we find that data scientists are significantly more effective and efficient at performing 
								data wrangling tasks than manual programming. Through qualitative feedback, participants report that Wrex reduced 
								barriers in having to recall or look up the usage of various data transform functions. Data scientists indicated 
								that the availability of readable code allowed them to verify that the data transform would do what they intended and 
								increased their trust and confidence in the wrangling tool. Moreover, inserting synthesized code as cells is useful and 
								fits naturally with the way data scientists already work in notebooks.

							<p><strong>Wrex - notebook extension</strong></p>
							<p>Wrex is implemented as a Jupyter notebook extension. The front-end display component is based on Qgrid, an interactive grid view for editing data frames. 
								Several changes were made to this component to support code generation: <br/> 
								First, we modified Qgrid to render views of the underlying dataframe, rather than the dataframe itself. 
								Second, we added the ability to add new columns to the grid. By implementing both of these changes, users are able to give examples through virtual columns without affecting the underlying data. 
								Third, we added a view component to Qgrid to render the code block.
								Finally, we bound to appropriate event handlers to invoke our program synthesis engine on cell changes.
								To automatically display the interactive grid for dataframes, the back-end component injects configuration options to the Python pandas library and overrides its HTML display mechanism.</p>
							<p><strong>Readable program synthesis algorithm</strong></p>
							The program synthesis engine that powers Wrex substantially extends the FlashFill toolkit, which provide several domain specific languages (DSLs) with operators that support 
							string transformations, number transformations, date transformations, and table lookup transformations.
							<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05964" class="link">A technical report by Gulwani et al.</a> formally describes the semantics of extensions; Wrex uses these extensions and surfaced this PBE algorithm through an interaction that is accessible to data scientists.

							<h1 class="major">In-lab comparative study</h1>
							<p><strong>Participants:</strong> 12 data scientists (10 male), randomly selected from a directory of computational notebook users with Python familiarity within a large, data-driven software company. 
								They self-reported an average of 4 years of data science experience within the company. 
								They self-rated familiarity with Jupyter notebooks with a median of "Extremely familiar" (5) and 
								their familiarity with Python at a median of "Moderately familiar" (4) on a 5-point Likert scale.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Tasks:</strong>  Participants completed six tasks using two different datasets. 
								These tasks involved transformations commonly done by data scientists during data wrangling, 
								such as extracting part of a string and changing its case, formatting dates, time-binning, 
								and rounding floating-point numbers.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Protocol:</strong> Participants were assigned A and B datasets through a counterbalanced design, 
								such that half the participants received the A dataset first (A-dataset group), 
								and the other half received the B dataset first (B-dataset group). 
								We randomized task order within each dataset to mitigate learning effects.
								They first completed three tasks with a Jupyter notebook (manual condition). 
								They had 5 minutes per task to read the requirements of the task and write code to complete the task. 
								<br/><br/>								
								At the end of the manual condition, we interviewed the participants about their experience and 
								asked them to complete a questionnaire to rate aspects of their experience.
								<br/><br/>								
								Next, participants completed a short tutorial that introduced them to Wrex.
								After participants completed the tutorial, they moved on to the second set of tasks, 
								this time using Wrex with conditions similar to the first set of tasks. 
								After the three tasks are completed, we again interviewed them about their experience and 
								asked them to complete the questionnaire.

							<h1 class="major">Results</h1>
						<p><strong>Quantitative results</strong><br/><br/>
						<i>Task completion:</i>
						Table 2 shows completion rates by task and condition. There was a significant difference between the Wrex and manual conditions, both dataset subgroups. 
						Participants in the manual condition completed 12/36 tasks, while those in the Wrex condition completed all 36/36 tasks. 
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WrexTable2.png" alt="" /></span>

						<br/>
						<i>Participant Efficiency:</i>
						Table 3 shows the distribution of completion times by task and condition, and the participants' self-reported frequency of how often they do that type of task. 
						Participants using Wrex, on average, were about 40 seconds faster (u = 0.60, sd = 0.53) in A dataset, and about 1.6 minutes faster (u = 1.61, $sd = 0.31) in B dataset.
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WrexTable3.png" alt="" /></span>

						<br/>
						<i>Grid and Code Acceptability:</i>
						Table 4 shows distribution of acceptability for the grid, the code acceptability during the study (Code<sub>1</sub>), and the code acceptability after post-study improvements (Code<sub>2</sub>). 
						Participants reported the median acceptability of the grid experience as Acceptable (5). The code acceptability during the study (Code<sub>1</sub>) had substantial variation in responses, with a median of Neutral (3). 
						After improving the program synthesis engine based on the participant feedback (Code<sub>2</sub>), the median score improved to Acceptable (5). 
						As a measure of user satisfaction, we asked participants if they would use Wrex for data wrangling tasks if a production version of the tool was made available: five participants reported that they would "probably use the tool" (4), 
						and seven reported that they would "definitely use the tool" (5).

						<p><strong>Qualitative feedback</strong><br/><br/>
						<i>Reducing Barriers to Data Wrangling:</i>
						<br/>
						(1) Recall of Functions and Syntax -
						The most common barrier reported by participants, both within our lab study and in their daily work, 
						is remembering what functions and syntax are required to perform the necessary data transformations as "it is just tough to memorize all the nuances of a language" (P5).
						Wrex reduces this barrier with the synthesis of readable code via PBE. 
						This removes the need for data scientists to remember the specific functions or syntax needed for a 
						transformation. Instead, they need only know what they want to do with the data in order to produce code.
						<br/>
						(2) Searching for Solutions -
						Wrex reduced participants' reliance on web searches. Instead of hunting online for the right syntax or API calls, 
						they could remain in the context of their wrangling activities and only had to provide the expected output for data transformations.
						Participants immediately noticed the time it took to complete the three tasks with Wrex compared to doing so with a 
						default Jupyter notebook and web search: "I super liked it, it was amazing, really quick, I didn't have to look up or browse anything else" (P9); 
						Wrex also "avoided my back and forth from Stack Overflow" (P12). 
						By removing the need to search websites and code repositories, Wrex allows data scientists to remain in the context of their analysis.
						<br/><br/>

						<i>Fitting into Data Scientists' Workflows:</i>
						<br/>
						Wrex helps address the above barriers by providing familiar interactions that reduce the need for syntax recall and code-related web searches. 
						Wrex's grid felt familiar, lessening the learning curve required to perform data wrangling tasks with the system. This form of interaction 
						was likened to "the pattern recognition that Excel has when you drag and drop it" and that Wrex had a "nice free text flow" (P5). 
						Feedback for the grid interaction was overwhelmingly positive, with only minor enhancements suggested such as a right-click 
						context menu and better horizontal scrolling. Participants agreed that this tool fit into their workflow. 
						They were enthusiastic about not having to leave the notebook when performing their day-to-day data wrangling tasks. 
						By having a tool that generates wrangling code directly in their notebook, participants felt that they could easily iterate between data wrangling and analysis.
						<br/><br/>

						<i>Data Scientists' Expectations of Synthesized Code:</i>
						<br/>
						(1) Readability of Synthesized Code - 
						Participants described readability as being a critical feature of usable synthesized code. 
						P6 wanted "to read what the code was doing and make sure it was doing what I expect it to do, in case there was an ambiguity I didn't pick up on". 
						It is also important for collaboration (P12). Participants also cited readability as an enabler for debugging and maintenance, 
						where readable code would allow them to make small changes to the code themselves rather than provide more examples to the interactive grid.
						<br/><br/>

						(2) Trust in Synthesized Code -
						The most salient method to increase trust was reading the synthesized code. Inspecting the resulting wrangled dataframe is not enough, 
						and that without readable code they "don't know what is going on there, so I don't know if I can trust it if I want to extend it to other tasks. 
						I saw my examples were correctly transformed, but because the code is hard to read, I would not be able to trust what it is doing" (P10). 
						Several participants noted that the best way to gain the confidence of a user in these types of tools is to "have the code be readable" (P4).
